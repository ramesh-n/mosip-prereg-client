MOSIP is Modular Open Source Identity Platform, read and learn more about it in the extensive [documentation](https://github.com/mosip-open/Documentation). The seed contribution to MOSIP is still work in progress, consider this repo as an early preview for now. For now, we aim to give the community a sense of early direction with this preview. 

The issue list is open, but we will not act upon the issues till a formal release is behind us.
